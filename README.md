# Super Starter Expo
ðŸš€ A starting point for building expo RN apps, with baked in out of the box support for Persistance, Redux (Selectors, Sagas &amp; Reducers), Push Notifications, Styled Components and more...

This project extends the [Romulus CLI from Simpleweb](https://github.com/simpleweb/romulus-cli) but geared toward Expo's managed development workflow.

Also included are a range of screens, extending expo's tabs template.

As a product the idea is to update the styling of screens that focus on push event driven experiences.

Remove the need for dealing with XCode/Android studio and use Expo's features.

Folder Structure is suitable for small/medium sized projects as it focuses on vertical folder complexity over horizontal.
